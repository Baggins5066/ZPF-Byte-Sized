Zombie Pro Fisher was a gag game that was conceptualized by my friend and I. It started at our friends birthday party, on a boat in a lake that was just adjacent to the Sequoyah Nuclear Powerplant in Chattanooga Tennessee.
Joking for years about turning it into a real game, I took it upon myself to make the first iteration - this text-based adventure/survival game made with C++. While its riddled with inside jokes that only me and my friends might understand,
the game is appropriate and fun for anyone who might want to play it.
